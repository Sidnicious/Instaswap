# Instaswap

I think that [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/) is awesome. [omni5cience](https://github.com/omni5cience) uses it too. When I just want to show him something I found online, email is too demanding. Why not add it to his Instapaper queue?

Once you register your Instapaper account with Instaswap, anyone can send you stories.

### Getting real

This is a hacky side project (and I don’t know PHP all that well) that I’m playing with mostly on the bus to and from work. It’s barely functional. I don’t think there are any major security holes but the code isn’t exactly pretty.
